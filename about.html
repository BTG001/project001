                        <p>The term bespoke speak for something, in the specialised meaning of "to give order for it to be made". Bespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from ready-to-wear, which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from made to measure, which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern.</p>
